# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We want this project to be a professional, respectful, and welcoming space
for everyone involved. All contributors, users, and maintainers are expected
to communicate clearly, act in good faith, and treat others with respect.

Collaboration should be constructive and focused on improving the project.
Disagreements may happen, but they should always be handled calmly and
professionally.

Maintainers are responsible for keeping discussions productive and may take
reasonable action when necessary to protect the community.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including issues, pull
requests, and discussions.

Thank you
